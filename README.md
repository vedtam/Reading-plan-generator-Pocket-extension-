# Ai assisted reading plan (Pocket extension)

We used to bookmark a lot of information from around the web, such as articles, papers, social posts, and videos. However, these bookmarks often just sit there without ever being read. This application aims to solve that problem by generating and updating a reading plan for the user. Through daily reminders and brief summaries generated by AI, we are able to keep the user updated and provide a weekly report containing all the unread bookmarks in a clean and understandable format. Thanks to AI, we are able to repackage the information and make it more accessible.
